    <h1>Hello CodeWorks!</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Cameron Kinzer</strong></p>
     <p>I enter Boise Code Works with a background in politics and government relations.<br>
     I attended Boise State and graduated with a degree in political science.<br>
     While I'm still facinated by the political process it doesn't offer a bright and diverse future<br>
     when it comes to job prospects. That's where coding comes in, which is something I've always been<br>
     interested in. I know that by completing this course I will increase my job prospects and I will <br> 
     gain a skill set that I can take anywhere. I'm excited about the course and becoming a developer.<br>
     In my spare time I enjoy playing and watching most sports and weight training. I also enjoy <br>
     video games, reading and spending time with friends and family.</p>
